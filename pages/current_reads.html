          Tatooine—a harsh desert world where farmers toil in the heat of two
          suns while trying to protect themselves and their loved ones from the
          marauding Tusken Raiders. A backwater planet on the edge of civilized
          space. And an unlikely place to find a Jedi Master in hiding, or an
          orphaned infant boy on whose tiny shoulders rests the future of a
          galaxy. Known to locals only as "Ben," the bearded and robed
          offworlder is an enigmatic stranger who keeps to himself, shares
          nothing of his past, and goes to great pains to remain an outsider.
          But as tensions escalate between the farmers and a tribe of Sand
          People led by a ruthless war chief, Ben finds himself drawn into the
          fight, endangering the very mission that brought him to Tatooine.
          Ben—Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, hero of the Clone Wars, traitor to the
          Empire, and protector of the galaxy's last hope—can no more turn his
          back on evil than he can reject his Jedi training. And when blood is
          unjustly spilled, innocent lives threatened, and a ruthless opponent
          unmasked, Ben has no choice but to call on the wisdom of the Jedi—and
          the formidable power of the Force—in his never-ending fight for
          justice.

          Obi-Wan Kenobi has not been apprenticed long to Qui-Gon Jinn, and he
          is chafing at Qui-Gon's training style: all meditation, no action.
          Obi-Wan yearns to prove himself on a mission, but when he and Qui-Gon
          are finally set to leave on an assignment, Qui-Gon is nowhere to be
          found. Angered by his master's abandonment, Obi-Wan sets out on the
          mission alone, determined to prove himself. On a mysterious planet he
          encounters a pack of feral, Force-wielding teens who seem to be the
          planet's only inhabitants. As he experiences wild freedom with them
          and wonders if this isn't the life he was meant for, Obi-Wan can't
          escape the nagging sense that something is wrong with the Force there.
          Growing attachments, startling revelations, and a looming threat to
          both the planet and his new friends will bring Obi-Wan face-to-face
          with his worst fear: that maybe he was never supposed to be a Jedi at
          all. Can he connect with the living Force in time to save himself and
          everyone around him?
